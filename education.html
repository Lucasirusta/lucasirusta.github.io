	<h1> Help Protect little penguins</h1>
	
		<ul>
		
<li>Keep Sydney Harbour clean
Put your rubbish in the bin as discarded waste can suffocate and injure little penguins. Fishing lines and hooks on the foreshore or in the water can strangle them or injure their feet and flippers. Be a good citizen and pick up other rubbish too!</li>

<li>Report any pollution to the Environment Line on 132 555 (24 hours, 7 days).</li>

<li>Keep pets away from critical habitat
Dogs, cats and foxes are still a big threat to little penguins and are excluded from the little penguins' critical habitat. Owners need to keep pets indoors or in secure backyards at night.</li>

<li>Fines apply for owners if domestic pets are found within the critical habitat area.</li>

<li>No vegetation removal or building works without approval in Critical Habitat B
For more information, visit the critical habitat page for Manly little penguins.</li>

<li>Report anyone harming the penguins
It is an offence to harm little penguins, their habitat or critical habitat. Report anyone undertaking illegal activities or causing harm to a little penguin including hunting, shooting, poisoning, netting, snaring, spearing, pursuing, capturing or trapping them. Contact the Environment Line on 131 555.</li>

	<h1> Where can I see Manly's little penguins? </h1>
	
		<p>The population numbering approximately 60–70 breeding pairs lives in secluded coves and is the only remaining breeding colony on the NSW mainland.</p>
	<p> Little penguins forage for food throughout Sydney Harbour and along the Sydney coast, with frequent sightings around Bondi, Botany Bay, Mosman, Narrabeen and Vaucluse. Some of our penguins have even travelled as far as Victoria.</p>

<div class="eduright">
	<h1> Reducing injuries & death</h1>
	<p>Unfortunately little penguins are still being injured and killed by dogs and foxes. In June 2015, 26 little penguins were killed in North Head, by what is believed to be a single fox – a massive loss in a small population. </p>
	<p>single fox – a massive loss in a small population. 

Domestic pets are prohibited within the little penguin critical habitat. Dogs must be on a lead in other foreshore areas where penguins are known to occur.</p>

	<h1> Hurt or just Moulting</h1>
		<p>Each year little penguins moult and grow a new set of feathers to stay waterproof in the coming year. Moulting can take up to 17 days which means that in this time penguins are not waterproof and must stay on land. </p>
	<p>They are unable to feed and are particularly vulnerable to disturbance and predation. It is, however, a natural part of their cycle and they should not be rescued.</p>

	<h1>How big is the Manly population</h1>
	<p>In the past there were hundreds of little penguins in Sydney’s North Harbour. During the 1990s numbers were thought to be as low as 35 breeding pairs.

However, following a concentrated effort by National Parks and Wildlife Service, Office of Environment and Heritage, Manly Council, Manly Environment Centre, Taronga Zoo and the community, there are now around 60–70 breeding pairs.
